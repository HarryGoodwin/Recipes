**COOK** 55 mins  
**SERVES** 6  
**COST PER SERVE:** $1.64

### Ingredients
- 1 cup pitted dates, chopped  
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda  
- ¼ cup unsalted butter  
- 340g pkt Woolworths vanilla cake mix  
- 2 eggs, whisked  
- ½ ripe banana, halved lengthways  
- ¼ cup double cream  

#### Toffee sauce
- ½ cup brown sugar  
- ¾ cup thickened cream  
- ¼ cup unsalted butter

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan-forced. Grease and line a 20cm round cake pan with baking paper.  
   Add dates and ¾ cup water to a small saucepan on low heat. Simmer for 10 minutes until dates have softened.  
   Add bicarbonate of soda and mix well. Cool for 1 minute until the mixture is light and fluffy.  
   Add butter to the pan and cook for 2 minutes until butter is melted. Remove from heat and set aside.

2. Add cake mix, eggs and date mixture to a medium bowl. Using a wooden spoon, mix gently until well mixed together.  
   Spoon into prepared cake tin and smooth the top.

3. To make the toffee sauce, add all ingredients to a small saucepan on medium heat and cook for 2-3 minutes,  
   stirring occasionally, until melted. Pour ⅔ cup toffee sauce over pudding batter.  
   Using a butter knife, gently swirl the sauce into the pudding.

4. Place banana halves, cut-side up, over pudding batter.  
   Bake for 35 minutes or until the top is browned and a skewer inserted at the centre comes out clean.  
   Drizzle over remaining toffee sauce. Serve with a dollop of cream.
